# Diabetes-Prediction

## Overview
We will develop a machine learning model that will predict whether a patient has diabetes or not on the basis of the attributes that we will provide to our model.

## Data Used
The data used is [PIMA Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

## Libraries Used
